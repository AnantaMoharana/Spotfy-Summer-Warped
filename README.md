# Spotify-Summer-Warped
An ETL pipeline that extracts data regarding the songs and artists in my Summer 2023 playlist on Spotify and stores it in a PostgreSQL database

This ETL pipeline was written using Python, Amazon Web Services, and PostgreSQL. It was orchestrated by Apache Airflow and run using a Docker container.
